    "Hey there, I'm Cammy and I created this challenge because it merged two things, I'm passionate about, fitness and supporting mental health. I've struggled with my mental health for a long time, but every time I've tried to get help it's even more of a struggle! Waiting lists are years long and getting pointed to the same self-help advice over and over again (which I've tried multiple times to no avail) is quite defeating.",
    "A year into my first office job, I had put on a fair bit of weight, which just made things worse for me. So, I decided to change something. I started going to a personal trainer who helped me get back into the gym and keep an eye on what I was eating. Since starting with him, I've lost some weight, built some muscle, and most importantly, improved my mental health.",
    "Now that I'm in a much better place, I want to do my part to help those who can't just go to the gym to find a better place."

    "Hi, Iâ€™m Pippa!! I decided to join this challenge alongside Cammy as fitness is something which I am very passionate about and has improved my mental health significantly.",
    "During University, I found myself to be very active as I participated in the Netball club and I also attended the gym on a regular basis. Saying this, I found it hard to be consistant during the end of my studies, which I felt to have a big upset on my mental health.",
    "Recently, I have started having more of a routine. I attend the gym with Cammy on a regular basis and also go to PT, which has changed not only my physical strength, but my mental strength too.",
    "I am looking forward to taking part in this challenge and raising awareness to taking mental health seriously."
