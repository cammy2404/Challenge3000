  description: "After finishing univeristy, I got myself a software engineering job in an office, this was great as it was what I had been working towards for years. However it meant that I left my previous job, working in a kitchen, which was lot more active than sitting at my desk 40 hours a week. After about a year I had put on some weight and got myself in a pretty bad place mentally. I decided to get back into the gym and start working out. This was the best decision I made in a long time. I felt healthier both physically and mentally."
