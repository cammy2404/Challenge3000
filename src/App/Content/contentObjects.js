    "Hey there, I'm Cammy and I created this challenge because it merged two things, I'm passionate about, fitness and supporting mental health. I've struggled with my mental health for a long time, but every time I've tried to get help it's even more of a struggle! Waiting lists are years long and getting pointed to the same self-help advice over and over again (which I've tried multiple times to no avail) is quite defeating.",
    "A year into my first office job, I had put on a fair bit of weight, which just made things worse for me. So, I decided to change something. I started going to a personal trainer who helped me get back into the gym and keep an eye on what I was eating. Since starting with him, I've lost some weight, built some muscle, and most importantly, improved my mental health.",
    "Now that I'm in a much better place, I want to do my part to help those who can't just go to the gym to find a better place."
